                <p>
                    I'm Christopher Books, but you can call me DualBorn — a name that reflects how I live between two worlds: 
                    the logical precision of code and the creative flow of music. I'm an engineer who believes in 
                    growth above all else. Stagnation disturbs me. I need to be learning, building, or creating something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got into web development because I loved the idea of building things that people actually use. 
                    There's something satisfying about writing clean code that not only works but feels good to use. 
                    Accessibility isn't just a checkbox for me — it's about making sure everyone can experience what I build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I'm either playing my acoustic guitar or sitting quietly, thinking. 
                    I speak less and listen more. I pay attention to the details most people miss.
                </p>

                    My Goals in HNG
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I joined HNG because I wanted to stretch myself and see what I'm really capable of. 
                    This is what I'm hoping to achieve:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Master modern frontend tools — I want to get comfortable with frameworks like React, Next and Vue</li>
                    <li>Build real-world projects. I want to ship things that solve actual problems</li>
                    <li>Work with diverse talents — HNG connects people from different backgrounds and skill levels</li>
                    <li>Push my limits — I want to take on tasks that scare me a little. That's where growth happens</li>
                    <li>Share the little I know with others</li>
                    <li>Land opportunities — and grow</li>
                </ul>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not going to pretend I know everything. Here's where I still feel shaky:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performance optimization — I can make things work, but I sometimes don't always know if my code is efficient</li>
                    <li>Speaking up in groups — I'm naturally quiet sometimes until I'm comfortable enough to speak and that can take a little while</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>Hey,</p>
                    <p>
                        If you're reading this, hopefully you've made it through HNG and leveled up. 
                        Remember how nervous you were starting this? How you weren't sure if you were good enough? 
                        You did it anyway. That's what matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't forget why you started this. You wanted growth. You wanted to connect with people who 
                        push you forward. You wanted to prove to yourself that you can do hard things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If things didn't go as planned, that's okay. You learned something. You're still moving forward. 
                        If things went well, don't get comfortable. There's always another level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep listening. Keep building. Keep growing.
                    </p>

                    Extra Thoughts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think the best developers aren't the ones who know everything — they're the ones who know how to figure things out. 
                    I'm still early in my journey, but I'm committed to getting better every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in building things that matter. Not just for portfolios or resumes, but things that actually help people. 
                    Code is a tool, not the end goal. The end goal is impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HNG is intense, and I know there will be moments where I doubt myself. But that's part of the process. 
                    Growth isn't comfortable. If it was easy, everyone would do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm here to learn, to connect, and to prove to myself that I can do this. Let's see where it goes.
